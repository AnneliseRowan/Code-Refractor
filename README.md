A marketing agency has hired me to refractor this code to make it more accessible. It needs to meet the following criteria: 

There should be semantic elements throughout the code. The structure of the HTML should be logical in both styling and positioning. The image elements should have accessible and descriptive alt attributes. The heading attributes should fall in sequential order, as well as, the title elements being concise and descriptive. The CSS needs to be combined so as to not be so repetitive.
